## What is a Grand Tour

In case you are not a cycling fan and don't know what a Grand Tour is here is a definition from Wikipedia: 

In road bicycle racing, a Grand Tour is one of the three major European professional cycling stage races: Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espa√±a. Collectively they are termed the Grand Tours, and all three races are similar in format being multi-week races with daily stages. They have a special status in the UCI regulations: more points for the UCI World Tour are distributed in Grand Tours than in other races, and they are the only stage races allowed to last longer than 14 days.

## Example of the app (Tour de France)

Tour de France is the biggest from the three Grand Tours and attracts interest from outside the traditional cycling regions (Europe and Columbia).

```{r,results='asis',message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(googleVis)
#load the data
data <- read.csv("TDF.csv")
colnames(data) <- c("country","index")
#print the chart
p1 <- gvisGeoChart(data,locationvar = "country",colorvar = "index")
print(p1, tag = "chart")
```
